    More advanced prompts can be used to create a workspace with multiple files or to create different project types. For example, you can use the following prompt specify additional conditions for the console app project:

    ```text
    Create a C# console app that prints Hello World to the console. Include a README file and a .gitignore file.
    ```

### Explore the Quick Chat features

The Quick Chat window is a simplified interface for interacting with GitHub Copilot. It provides a quick way to ask questions, request code suggestions, or get help with specific tasks without leaving the code editor.

1. Open the Chat menu and notice that three Chat options are listed.

    ![Screenshot showing the Chat menu with inline chat disabled.](./Media/m01-github-copilot-menu-chat-options.png)

    The three Chat options are:

    - Open Chat: This option is used to open the Chat view.

    - Editor Inline Chat: This option is used to interact with GitHub Copilot directly in the code editor. The Inline Chat option is only enabled when there's a file open in the editor.

    - Quick Chat: This option is used to interact with GitHub Copilot using a simplified interface. You can use quick chat to ask questions, request code suggestions, or get help with specific tasks without leaving the code editor.

1. On the Chat menu, select **Quick Chat**.

    By default, the Quick Chat window opens at the top center of the Visual Studio Code window.

1. Notice that the Quick Chat window provides many of the same options provided with the Chat view.

1. Use the Quick Chat window to submit the following prompt:

    ```text
    Tell me about the Program.cs file
    ```

    Without additional context, the response is likely to be a description of how Program.cs files are used in various project types.

1. To add your Program.cs file to the Quick Chat context, drag-and-drop the Program.cs file from the Explorer view to the top of the Quick Chat window.

1. Notice that the Quick Chat window now includes **Program.cs** to the right of the **Add Context** button.

    > **TIP**: Adding project files to the Chat context (Chat view, Quick Chat, or Inline Chat) helps GitHub Copilot provide more relevant suggestions. When adding project files to the Chat context, it's often easier to use a drag-and-drop operation rather than the Add Context button.

1. Scroll to the top of the Quick Chat window and resubmit the same prompt:

    ```text
    Tell me about the Program.cs file
    ```

1. Notice that the new response describes the contents of your Program.cs file rather than a general description of how Program.cs files are used.

1. In the top-right corner of the Quick Chat window, select **Open in Chat View**.

    Notice that the Quick Chat window closes and the Chat view opens with responses that appeared the Quick Chat window. If the Chat view doesn't display the Quick Chat session, use the Chat menu to open the Quick Chat window, and then select **Open in Chat View**.

    Switching to the Chat view is useful when you need to extend and manage a chat session that started in the Quick Chat window.

    > **TIP**: The Quick Chat window is great for quick questions and simple tasks. However, if you want a more dedicated Chat environment, you should use the Chat view. The Chat view provides a more comprehensive interface for interacting with GitHub Copilot and includes features like chat history, file management, and more advanced options for managing your chat sessions.

### Explore the Inline Chat features
